## Security

All the roles apart from the **Business owner** have user/group IAM policy restrictions, 
this is to ensure data does not get removed or shared with unauthorized individuals/organisations.

The restrictions used are as follows:

```HCL
statement {
    sid = "PeventModifyingSelfGroup"
    effect = "Deny"
    actions = [
      "iam:AttachGroupPolicy",
      "iam:DetachGroupPolicy"
    ]
    resources = [
      "arn:aws:iam::${var.account_id}:group/XXX",
    ]
  }
  
statement {
    sid = "PeventModifyingSelf"
    effect = "Deny"
    actions = [
      "iam:CreatePolicyVersion",
      "iam:CreatePolicy"
    ]
    resources = [
      "arn:aws:iam::${var.account_id}:policy/oso-devops-engineer-group-policy",
    ]
}
```

This snippet prevents the user from modifying the group they belong to or the underlying policy of the group. 

```HCL
statement {

    effect = "Deny"
    actions = [
      "s3:DeleteBucket"
    ]
    resources = [
      "*"
    ]
  }

  statement {

    effect = "Deny"
    actions = [
       "rds:DeleteDBCluster",
       "rds:DeleteDBInstance"
    ]
    resources = [
      "*"
    ]
  }
```

The following snippet makes sure that neither s3 nor RDS data can be lost by deleting either resource.
